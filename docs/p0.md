>If you have any preliminary comments on your submission, notes for the TAs, please give them here.

I tested my console on a macos laptop and it seems the key bindings are a bit different for mac (the physical backspace actually corresponds to `0x7f` while \<C-h\> corresponds to `0x08`, the actual \<BS\>). In my submission I used `\b` as the \<BS\>.

## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

ljmp $0xf000,$0xe05b

>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located? 

0xffff0

#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

It first set up the serial port at the very beginning using `int $0x14`. During the kernel-finding process, it calls `read_sector`, which then uses BIOS interrupt `int $0x13` coupled with `0x42` in `%ah` to perform an extended read.

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

The bootloader first iterates through every sector, every drive and every partition. It first verifies the presence of an MBR signature (`cmpw $0xaa55, %es:510`) to check if the drive has been indeed partitioned. Then, after finding an used (`cmpl $0, %es:(%si)`), Pintos kernel (`cmpb $0x20, %es:4(%si)`), and bootable (`cmpb $0x80, %es:(%si)`) partition, it decides that it has successfully found the Pintos kernel.

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

It outputs "Not Found" and notify BIOS that boot failed by triggering an BIOS interrupt (`$0x18`).

>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

At address `7cd3`, after successfully finding and booting the Pintos kernel, the bootloader stores the start address of the Pintos kernel into a proxy (`%dx` or `start`), which is then used in an indirect long jump (`ljmp *(%esi)` or `ljmp *start`) to the `pintos_init()` function in Pintos kernel.

#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?

0x0

>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,

>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?
>> 
>> #0  palloc_get_page (flags=(PAL_ASSERT | PAL_ZERO)) at ../../threads/palloc.c:112
>>
>> #1  0xc00203aa in paging_init () at ../../threads/init.c:168
>>
>> #2  0xc002031b in pintos_init () at ../../threads/init.c:100
>>
>> #3  0xc002013d in start () at ../../threads/start.S:180

>> B8.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 0xc0101000

>> B8.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 0x0



>B9: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B9.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>> #0  palloc_get_page (flags=PAL_ZERO) at ../../threads/palloc.c:112
>>
>> #1  0xc0020a81 in thread_create (name=0xc002e895 "idle", priority=0, function=0xc0020eb0 <idle>, aux=0xc000efbc) at ../../threads/thread.c:178
>>
>> #2  0xc0020976 in thread_start () at ../../threads/thread.c:111
>>
>> #3  0xc0020334 in pintos_init () at ../../threads/init.c:119
>>
>> #4  0xc002013d in start () at ../../threads/start.S:180 

>> B9.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 0xc0103000 

>> B9.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 0x102027



## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)

#### 

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.

I use `input_getc` from `devices/input.c` for input. For output, I use both `printf` from `lib/stdio.c` and `putchar`, `puts` from `lib/kernel/console.c`.

I implemented backspace in my monitor. When it receives `\b` (`0x08`), it outputs consecutively `\b`, ` `(space), `\b` to the monitor to cover up the previous character.
